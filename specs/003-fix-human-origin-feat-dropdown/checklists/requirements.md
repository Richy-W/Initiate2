# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Human Origin Feat Dropdown

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- This is a narrowly scoped defect fix: only the UI control type for origin feat selection changes. No backend data model, API contracts, or submission logic changes are required.
- The 5 origin feats currently in the catalogue (Alert, Magic Initiate, Savage Attacker, Skilled, Tough) are documented in SC-002 as the expected count; this should be verified against live data during implementation.
